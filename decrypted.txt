the hotel, the casino. the corleone family wants to buy you out.
that's my family kay, that's not me.
it's an old habit. i spent my whole life trying not to be careless. women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.
my father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. he taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

what's the matter with you, huh? what am i going to do? am i going to make that baby an orphan before he's born?
do me this favor. i won't forget it. ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. they'll tell you i know how to return a favor.
you talk about vengeance. is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? or my boy to me?
my father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.
i don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak english.

in sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.
i'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.
i have a sentimental weakness for my children and i spoil them, as you can see. they talk when they should listen.
your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.
fredo, you're my older brother, and i love you. but don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. ever.
